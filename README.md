uExplorer is an application designed to assist tourists in finding the nearest amenities, services, and attractions to their current, and most likely unfamiliar, location. While it was created with the intention of assisting those new to an area, it also proves useful to locals and anyone else looking to learn more about the area surrounding the grounds they stand on.

In its current state, VSTR features an interactive map that pulls the user’s current location (upon user approval) and displays nearby places-of-interest to the user. Preloaded categories of “Dining”, “Shopping”, “Landmarks”, “Bars”, and “Music” exist alongside the user’s capability to search and customize three additional categories to best suit their personal interests. Simplifying and limiting the search results to one category at a time allows users to select specific, narrowed-down categories to create a simple, easy to view UI.

Table 3: Types supported in place autocomplete requests
You may restrict results from a Place Autocomplete request to be of a certain type by passing a types parameter. The parameter specifies a type or a type collection, as listed in the supported types below. If nothing is specified, all types are returned. In general only a single type is allowed. The exception is that you can safely mix the geocode and establishment types, but note that this will have the same effect as specifying no types. The supported types are:

geocode instructs the Place Autocomplete service to return only geocoding results, rather than business results. Generally, you use this request to disambiguate results where the location specified may be indeterminate.
address instructs the Place Autocomplete service to return only geocoding results with a precise address. Generally, you use this request when you know the user will be looking for a fully specified address.
establishment instructs the Place Autocomplete service to return only business results.
The (regions) type collection instructs the Places service to return any result matching the following types:
locality
sublocality
postal_code
country
administrative_area_level_1
administrative_area_level_2
The (cities) type collection instructs the Places service to return results that match locality or administrative_area_level_3.
Table 4: Deprecated types
The following types have been deprecated and are no longer supported. If you are using one of these types, consult Table 1 to find a suitable alternative.
establishment
finance
food
general_contractor
grocery_or_supermarket
health
place_of_worship
